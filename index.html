				<div class="popup hide" id="imageText2">
					<h2>Harley's Jake-in-the-Box</h2>
					<p>The "Jake-in-the-Box" is a playful and eccentric contraption found in the "Batman: Arkham" series of video games, closely linked with the character Harley Quinn. Much like the Fun Gun, it serves as a humorous weapon wielded by Harley Quinn to sow disorder and add an extra layer of challenge to Batman's pursuits. The Jake-in-the-Box is essentially a transformed jack-in-the-box toy, ingeniously repurposed into a weapon, embodying Harley's whimsical and unpredictable persona.</p>
					<h3>Can be seen in</h3>

				<div class="popup hide" id="imageText3">
					<h2>Joker's dagger</h2>
					<p>Since the fall of the Regime, Harley Quinn has found little solace in the incarceration of Superman. Still feeling a tremendous void left by Joker's death, Harley remains an unstable and uneasy ally. Resolute in her conviction, she refuses to let fugitives, assassins, or even criminals she once called friends stand in the way of her exacting revenge upon the man who silenced the Jokerâ€™s laugh.</p>

					<h2>Harley's Mallet</h2>

It has become an iconic part of her character's visual identity and is beloved by fans of the character.</p>
